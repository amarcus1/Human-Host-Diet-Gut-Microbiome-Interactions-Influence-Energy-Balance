# Reprogramming-the-Human-Gut-Microbiome-Reduces-Dietary-Energy-Harvest

A program used to calculate the dietary energy balance for subjects in the calorimetry consuming controlled diet.

## 1. System Requirement

We developed the current model using Microsoft Excel 2019. The Excel file works on almost any personal computers with Microsoft Excel.  There is no special non-standard hardware requirement.

## 2. Installation Guide

Users may download the Excel file.

## 3. Demo

### Instructions to run on data

Currently, the model is configured for Participant MAC1 Consuming the MD diet with intake of 1581 g per 6 d Carbohydrate, 507 g per 6 d Protein, 452 g per 6 d Fat, 303 g per 6 d fibers, and 120 g per 6 d of resistance starch.  A user may change the fields D2:D7 in "Dietary Input" sheet to consider other model scenarios.

### Expect output

With the current model configuration, Dietary Input is 644.9 gCOD/d and Fecal Output is 70.9 gCOD/d
giving an Overall COD Absorption Efficiency of 1 - 70.9/644.9 = 89%

### Expected runtime for demo on a "normal" desktop computer

The model runs within a second.

## 4. Instructions for use

Adjust the Dietary Input for each participant, as stated above.
